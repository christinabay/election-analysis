## 3. Election-Audit Summary

Election Commissioner:
The script used to audit this congressional election can easily be translated and fit to analyze an election in other counties, states, or federally. The framework allows the analyst to simply change the geographic criteria and provide the same results for other elections/geographies. 

The commissioner would benefit from the following modifications to the script, providing even more information to the commissoner's office:     
- Determine the number of votes each candidate receieved by county. This will enable candidates to assumptions about future elections (likelihood of winning in a specific county, how much money each candidate should spend on marketing in that county based on how it's residents historically vote, and where low-turnout areas can be encouraged to turn out, etc)
- Collecting further demographic information about the age, gender, education level (etc) of voters in each county would allow us to make polling predictions in the future. This helps candidates understand their odds in certain counties, and how to effectively reach voters.
